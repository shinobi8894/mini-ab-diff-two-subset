# Minimize the absolute difference of sum of two subsets
Given a number n, divide first n natural numbers (1, 2, …n) into two subsets such that difference between sums of two subsets is minimum.
Examples: 
```
Input : n = 4
Output : First subset sum = 5, 
         Second subset sum = 5.
         Difference = 0
Explanation:
Subset 1: 1 4 
Subset 2: 2 3 

Input : n = 6 
Output: First subset sum = 10, 
        Second subset sum = 11.
        Difference = 1
Explanation : 
Subset 1: 1 3 6 
Subset 2: 2 4 5 
```
